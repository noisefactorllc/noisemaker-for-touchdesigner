/*
 * Extrude - Photoshop-style block/pyramid extrusion toward the viewer.
 *
 * The image is divided into a `size`x`size`-pixel grid using tile-aware
 * GLOBAL pixel coordinates (gl_FragCoord + tileOffset), so the grid is
 * stable across CLI tile boundaries. The grid is ANCHORED AT THE IMAGE
 * CENTER (cell index = floor((pos - imgCenter)/size)), not at the
 * framebuffer origin: GLSL's origin is the bottom-left corner while
 * WGSL's is the top-left, so an origin-anchored grid lands its
 * horizontal boundaries (fullResolution.y mod size) pixels apart between
 * the two backends whenever the height is not an exact multiple of size
 * (proven empirically: an 11.4% cross-backend pixel mismatch at
 * 1024px/size=24, with mismatched pixels differing by exactly the ratio
 * of two SHADE_* constants - the same pixel classifying onto
 * differently-shaded faces). A center-anchored grid is mirror-symmetric
 * about the image center, so both backends see the identical visual
 * grid - and it is also the natural anchor for an effect whose entire
 * geometry radiates from the image center. Each cell has a height h in
 * [0,1]: depthSource luminance uses a small 3x3 average sample at the
 * cell center (S2 luminance of that average, per the brief); depthSource
 * random uses hash12(cellId), where cellId is the GLOBAL center-relative
 * cell index, so the hash is identical for a given cell regardless of
 * which tile is rendering it - tile-aware by construction. (The WGSL
 * port hashes the same index unchanged: in this runtime both backends'
 * fragment positions are content-Y-up, so the center-anchored cell
 * indices already coincide cross-backend - see extrude.wgsl's header.)
 *
 * Each cell's height maps to a scale factor s = 1 + h*(depth/100)*0.4
 * (s in [1, 1.4] at depth=100, per the brief's formula).
 *
 * blocks: the cell's square footprint, scaled by s ABOUT THE IMAGE
 * CENTER, is its projected top face - both the offset from center and
 * the face's own half-size grow by s, so taller cells both shift outward
 * AND enlarge: the classic "leaning toward the viewer, more so near the
 * frame edges" perspective-from-center look.
 *
 * pyramids: only the apex point (cell center scaled by s about the image
 * center) projects; the 4 side faces are triangles fanned from the
 * ORIGINAL (unscaled) footprint's 4 corners to that single projected
 * apex point.
 *
 * OCCLUSION ORDERING (why we walk toward the center, and why "top beats
 * side, else highest s wins"):
 *
 * Scaling a footprint about the image center by s>=1 only ever moves it
 * AWAY from the center. So the only cells whose PROJECTED face can ever
 * reach a given pixel P are: P's own cell, and cells strictly closer to
 * the image center than P (their scaled face can stretch out far enough
 * to cover P; cells farther out than P geometrically cannot reach back
 * in - their faces only move further away from P). We walk from P's own
 * cell toward the center, one cell-width at a time, for up to 6 steps
 * (bounded), and test each candidate.
 *
 * A cell's UN-scaled footprint can only ever contain pixels literally
 * inside that one cell (cells tile the plane without overlap), so a
 * "side-band" hit (pixel inside a cell's original footprint but outside
 * that SAME cell's scaled top face) can only ever occur for the walk's
 * distance-0 candidate (P's own cell) - every other candidate can only
 * ever contribute a top-face hit. Physically, any point on any block's
 * flat top face sits nearer the viewer (full extrusion height) than any
 * point on any side wall (which ramps from the footprint back up to the
 * top), so ties are broken: any top-face hit beats any side-band hit;
 * among top-face hits, the highest s (tallest / nearest the viewer)
 * wins, matching "nearer blocks occlude farther ones". Implemented as
 * one scalar priority = s + (isTop ? 1000.0 : 0.0), kept as a running
 * max while walking candidates - this naturally implements "test in
 * order of decreasing effective s, nearest-to-viewer wins" without an
 * explicit sort, since every candidate's priority is compared against
 * the running best so far.
 *
 * pyramids have no flat top tier (the apex is a single point), so every
 * hit is a "side" (slant-face) hit and priority is s alone.
 *
 * FACE COLOR / SHADING:
 * - blocks top face: solidFront ? cell-mean color : image resampled at
 *   the un-projected position (inverse of the "scale about center by s"
 *   map: localPos = imgCenter + (P-imgCenter)/s) - a "window" onto the
 *   original picture, unshaded (it is the flat, viewer-facing cap).
 * - blocks side band: ALWAYS the cell-mean color (Photoshop never maps
 *   image content onto a block's side walls, solidFront or not), times a
 *   per-side facing shade from a fixed simulated light (see SHADE_*
 *   below), chosen by whichever of left/right/top/bottom the pixel sits
 *   nearest to (simple |dx| vs |dy| quadrant split around the cell
 *   center).
 * - pyramids: every visible pixel is on one of the 4 slant faces, so
 *   solidFront toggles the same base (mean color vs. the barycentric
 *   un-projection of the winning triangle back onto the original
 *   corner+corner+cell-center triangle - apex unprojects to the cell
 *   center, since apex = cellCenter*s), and the facing shade is ALWAYS
 *   applied on top: mix(1.0, sideShadeConstant, apexBarycentricWeight) -
 *   full brightness at the (undisplaced) base edge, fading to the face's
 *   characteristic shade at the tip. This is the "barycentric-ish side
 *   shading" the brief calls for; "solidFront works the same" means it
 *   is the identical mean-vs-image toggle as blocks, just applied to a
 *   surface that is always shaded (pyramids have no unshaded flat cap).
 *
 * SHADE_* constants: simulated light from angle 150 degrees (standard
 * math convention: 0=+X/right, 90=+Y/up - i.e. mostly from the left,
 * slightly above), facing = dot(sideNormal, lightDir)*0.5+0.5, shade =
 * 0.55 + 0.45*facing (per the brief's formula). Precomputed here (GLSL
 * has no constant-expression sin/cos): left=0.969856 (brightest),
 * top=0.8875, bottom=0.6625, right=0.580144 (darkest) - four clearly
 * distinct facets, chosen over a symmetric 45/135-degree light so all
 * four sides read as visually different (the acceptance bar).
 *
 * Y ORIENTATION: GLSL and WGSL share a single TOP_SIGN constant,
 * verified only as mutually consistent between the two backends -
 * bit-exact cross-backend parity, nothing more. This algorithm is
 * flip-symmetric (center-anchored grid; a global Y-mirror is a
 * self-consistent relabeling), so that parity CANNOT determine the
 * absolute orientation: which way is visually "up" for the side
 * shading was never independently verified, and it is cosmetically
 * irrelevant here - left/right facets are unaffected, and a global
 * flip would swap top/bottom facet shading only. Effects with
 * genuinely Y-asymmetric semantics must NOT inherit an orientation
 * claim from this file; they need their own discriminating test (see
 * spinBlur's centerY fix for the pattern).
 *
 * ZERO-GUARD NOTE (depth=0): s=1 for every cell regardless of height, so
 * blocks' top face exactly reproduces the original footprint - every
 * pixel is a topHit on its own cell. With solidFront=false this is a
 * bit-exact passthrough (localPos = P exactly, s=1). With the SHIPPED
 * DEFAULT solidFront=true, depth=0 is NOT a passthrough - it settles
 * into flat per-cell mean-color posterization (Mosaic-alike), which is
 * the documented, intended resting state of this effect at its defaults,
 * not a bug (the brief explicitly anticipates and calls for this
 * reasoning). pyramids at depth=0 similarly degenerate to apex =
 * cellCenter, which splits every cell into 4 exact quarter-triangles
 * (the classic "connect center to all 4 corners" square decomposition) -
 * so even at depth=0, solidFront=true pyramids show a faceted radial-
 * gradient pattern per cell (never flat), because pyramids have no
 * flat-top tier at any depth. Both are intentional, documented per-mode
 * zero states, not passthroughs.
